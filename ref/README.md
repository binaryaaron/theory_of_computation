# Past reference material

A fellow student passed this stuff along to me. 

The folder 'moore_ref' has the following stuff in it:
* the folder 'old_homework' has ... you guessed it... old homeworks, most with
	solutions.
* the folder 'old_exams' has ... old exams.
* the automata notes are from chis moore as a companion to his book, Nature of
	Compuatation.

* [Past recorded lectures](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4NPTFQXfd8TOFhHc1doYzd0Sjg/view?usp=sharing),
	which are rather helpful and hosted on google drive instead of github. That
	was extremely important information to share, by the way.

	Otherwise, this folder has a has a rather nice set of notes
	for general CS Theory stuff by the venerable 
	[Jeff Erickson](http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~jeffe/teaching/algorithms/).
	You can grab the original individual topics from the above lin individual
	topics from the above link. 


Use and share away!

\section{Ex 23, Automata Notes}
\begin{quote}
  \textbf{Given a language \(L\), the language \(sort(L)\) consists of the words
  in L with their characters sorted in alphabetical order. For instance, if }
  \[ L = \{ bab, cca, abc\} \]
  then
  \[ sort(L) = \{ abb, acc, abc\}. \]
  \textbf{Give an example of a regular langauge \(L_1\) such that
  \(sort(L_1)\)  is nonregular and a nonregular language \(sort(L_2)\) such
  that \(sort(L_2)\) is regular. You may use any technique you like to prove that
  the languages are regular.}
\end{quote}
\subsection{Regular to Nonregular}
Let \[ L_1 = \text{palindrome over } \{ a,b \} \]
This implies that 
\[ sort(L_1) = \{a^mb^n | \text{either m or n is odd, not both}, |m|, |n|, \geq
0\} \]
as an example, the palindrome $abababa$ when sorted becomes $aaaabbb$. 

\subsection{Nonregular to regular}
Let \[ L_2 = (abaa^*)^* \].
Sorting $L_2$ gives us \[ a^mb^n | m > n \geq 0 \].

\section{Infinite sequences of languages}
\begin{quote}
  \textbf{Find an infinite sequence of languages \( A_0 \subset A_1 \subset A_2
    \subset \dots \subset A_k \subset \dots \)
    such that for each even \( n \), \( A_n\) is regular, and for each odd
    \(n\), \(A_n \) is non-regular. Prove your solution is correct.}

\section{Regex Golf}
\begin{quote}
  \textbf{Go to \href{https://regex.alf.nu/} and solve at least 5 of the
  puzzles.  Solving means finding a regular expression that matches a substring
of every string on the "match" list, and no substring of any string on the
"none of these" list. Of your solutions, submit the 5 you like best, along
with the score for each.  Your solutions should be proper regular expressions,
defined as follows:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item You may use ranges, such as [a-z]
  \item You may use the start-of-string character: \^
    and the end-of-string character: \$.
  \item You may use the OR character: |; 
    the Kleene star operator: *; and parentheses: (, ).
  \item You may NOT use backrefs or other constructs that allow the construction of
        expressions that match non-regular languages.  (The server allows some of
        these, despite calling the game "regexp golf," but this assignment does not.)
\end{itemize}
\end{quote}
\subsubsection*{Answer:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item level: warmup; \( foo \) : 207 pts
  \item level: anchors; \( k\$ \) : 208 pts
  \item level: ranges; \begin{verbatim}/^[a-f].*[a-f][abd-f]$/ \end{verbatim}: 179 pts
  \item level: long count; \begin{verbatim}/ 0.*1 0010 0011 0100 0101 0110 01+ 10+ 1001 1010 1011 1100 1101 1+0 1+$ / \end{verbatim} : 200 pts
\end{itemize}

\section{Context-Free Grammars}
\begin{quote}
  \textbf{Give Context-Free Grammars that generate the following languages over
    alphabet \(\{0,1\}\). Also say whether each language is regular.}
\end{quote}
\subsection{\(\{w : w \ \mbox{contains at least two 1's}\}\)}

\subsection{\(\{w : w \ \mbox{starts and ends with the same symbol, and has odd length}\}\)}
\subsubsection*{Answer:}

\subsection{\(\{wx : x \ \mbox{is a substring of the reverse of} \ w\}\)}

\section{Grammar and language}
\begin{quote}
  \textbf{What language is generated by the following grammar?
    Prove whether it is a regular language or not. THere are 3 variables:
  \(S, A, B\) and two terminals \(\{0,1\}\) }
\end{quote}
\begin{align*}
  S \to& AA,B \\
  A \to& 0A, A0, 1 \\
  B \to& 0B00,1
\end{align*}
\subsubsection{Answer}

\[ L = {{0*}1{0*}1{0*} | 0^n 1 0^2n | w \epsilon {0,1}* } \]



\section{Exercise 36, Automata notes}
\begin{quote}
  \textbf{Show that a 1-DCA can be simulated by a DPDA, and similarly for
  1-NCAs and NPDAs. Do you think this is true for two-counter automata as well?}
\end{quote}
